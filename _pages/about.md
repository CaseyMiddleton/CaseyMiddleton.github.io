I am a PhD student using mathematical modeling to study infectious diseases in the Department of Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder. 
During my PhD, I have worked with [Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/) on how to maximize the impact of diagnostic testing to identify and isolation infections as early as possible, with a particular focus on SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and RSV.
I have an anticipated graduation date of May 2025! 

I earned my BS in biomathematics with a minor in chemistry from Rhodes College in Memphis, TN.
During undergraduate, I had the opportunity to begin my mathematical modeling journey with published research on yellow fever outbreak control and predator-prey interactions between Golden Eagles and Island Foxes.
My research at this time primarily utilized ordinary differential equations models (ODEs), spatially agent/individual based models (ABMs), and geographic information systems (GIS).
I also had the opportunity to explore classes outside of my discipline, ranging from religious themes in American culture to art history to Eastern Asian studies.

After my time at Rhodes, I spent two years working in the non-profit sector, using GIS and data analytics to inform more equitable housing policy in Memphis.
My first year was spent serving with Volunteers in Service to America (Americorps VISTA) at Neighborhood Preservation, Inc.
Here, I wrote a "Rental Property Management Scorecard," which used publicly available data to score rental properties and landlords on how well they maintain their property.
This scorecard was used to pass a rental license ordinance, which requires landlords to receive regular property inspections in order to maintain a valid rental license, cutting down on poor rental housing conditions. 
During my VISTA year, I also coordinated Blight Elimination Steering Team meetings with local non-profits and government entities, hosted needs-based meetings with local neighborhood groups, and maintained public data availability for these neighborhood groups to use for revitalization purposes.
After my VISTA year, I spent one semester teaching tenth grade geometry, while the remainder of the year was spent working for the Mayor's Dashboard on special projects.
For the dashboard, I performed qualitative data analysis to understand why false alarms are triggered so often by home or business security systems and how local public transit could be improved.

I am now broadly interested in using math modeling to inform infectious disease policy decisions, especially for controlling respiratory pathogens.
In summer 2025, I will be seeking a job that allows me to pursue this passion and make an impact on disease transmission, while growing my computational and scientific communication skills.
