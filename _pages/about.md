Hi, I'm Casey! I am a post-doc at University of Melbourne with Drs. Freya Shearer and James McCaw. 

## Education
I received my PhD in computer science from University of Colorado Boulder in May, 2025 for my thesis entitled "Multiscale Infectious Disease Dynamics: Linking Epidemiology and Testing for Outbreak Neutralization" (did you catch the acronym?). During my PhD, I worked with [Dr. Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/) on how we can combine within-host and between-host models to make better predictions for infectious disease dynamics. You can read more on my publications page!

Prior to my PhD, I earned my BS in biomathematics with a minor in chemistry from Rhodes College in Memphis, TN.
During undergraduate, I had the opportunity to begin my mathematical modeling journey with published research on yellow fever outbreak control and predator-prey interactions between Golden Eagles and Island Foxes.
<!-- My research at this time primarily utilized ordinary differential equations models (ODEs), spatially agent/individual based models (ABMs), and geographic information systems (GIS). -->
I also had the opportunity to explore classes outside of my discipline, ranging from religious themes in American culture to art history to Eastern Asian studies.


## Work experience
After my undergraduate degree at Rhodes, I spent two years working in the non-profit sector, using GIS and data analytics to inform more equitable housing policy in Memphis.
My first year was spent serving with Volunteers in Service to America (Americorps VISTA) at Neighborhood Preservation, Inc.
Here, I wrote a "Rental Property Management Scorecard," which used publicly available data to score rental properties and landlords on how well they maintain their property.
This scorecard was used to pass a rental license ordinance, which requires landlords to receive regular property inspections in order to maintain a valid rental license, cutting down on poor rental housing conditions. 
<!-- During my VISTA year, I also coordinated Blight Elimination Steering Team meetings with local non-profits and government entities, hosted needs-based meetings with local neighborhood groups, and maintained public data availability for these neighborhood groups to use for revitalization purposes. -->
After my VISTA year, I spent one semester teaching tenth grade geometry, while the remainder of the year was spent working for the Mayor's Dashboard on special projects.
For the dashboard, I performed qualitative data analysis to understand why false alarms are triggered so often by home or business security systems and how local public transit could be improved.

## Hobbies
In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, distance running, and hand embroidery. While Boulder, Colorado has been an amazing place to call home and play outside while I completed my PhD, I am looking forward to a new adventure in Melbourne, Australia very soon!
